# WYS-Slycotton-Colors
Heya there! This is my github repository that I use to hold all my Will You Snail? color schemes! If you're coming from the download page for one of my campaigns, go to "Campaign Specific" and pick the one you need. If you just wanna try out some of my regular all-use color schemes, pick one of the ones out in the open. Thanks!
