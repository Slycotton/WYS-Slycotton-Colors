# WYS-Slycotton-Colors
Heya there! This is my github repository that I use to hold all my Will You Snail? color schemes! If you're coming from the download page for one of my campaigns, go to "Campaign Specific" and pick the one you need. If you just wanna try out some of my regular all-use color schemes, pick one of the ones out in the open. Thanks!

# How to import
First, unzip the folder. Then, go to Steam and right click on WYS, and click "Manage" and then "View Local Files". Open the "Colors" folder. Then, go back to the unzipped folder, take the folder witin with whatever name it has, plop it into the "Colors" folder and rename it to the highest unused number. If this is the first style you're getting, rename the folder to "9". If you've done this before, you know just to put it as the highest unused number to prevent issues. Then just go into your game settings, and under "Graphics" and "Colors", you'll be able to pick one. Enjoy!
